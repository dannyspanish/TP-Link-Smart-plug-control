A python script that can be used to turn on lamps connected to TP-Link smart plug based on the amount of light outside.

Mine runs daily using a raspberry pi from the hours of 16:00 - 22:00 via a cron job. 

This script was made possible by the work Alexandre Dumont (http://itnerd.space/2017/01/22/how-to-control-your-tp-link-hs100-smartplug-from-internet/)

Dependencies:
  - packages (requests, json, numpy, argparse and cv2)
  - Kasa UUID and token. Follow this guide: http://itnerd.space/2017/01/22/how-to-control-your-tp-link-hs100-smartplug-from-internet/
  - Reliable online webcam feed


I'm open to any suggestions and improvements. ENJOY :D
